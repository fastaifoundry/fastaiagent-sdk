# Concepts & Mental Model

This page is the mental model for evaluation — *why* you evaluate, the
*pipeline* every eval follows, the *families* of scorers and when to reach for
each, what they *cost*, and how evaluation closes the loop back into a better
agent. Read it first, then use the reference pages
([LLM-as-Judge](llm-judge.md), [Trajectory](trajectory-scoring.md),
[Session](session-scoring.md), [RAG](rag-metrics.md), [Safety](safety-metrics.md),
and the rest) for depth.

## Why evaluate

A prompt change that looks better on one example can quietly regress ten
others. Evaluation replaces "it seemed fine when I tried it" with a repeatable
measurement: run the agent over a dataset, score every case, and get a number
you can compare across versions. It runs **entirely offline** — no cloud
service required — and persists to the local UI so you can track it over time.

You evaluate at four moments: while **developing** (does this change help?),
before **release** (does it beat the last version on a golden set?), in **CI**
(gate merges on a regression threshold), and against **production traces**
(is quality holding on real traffic?).

## The evaluation pipeline

Every eval — one-off or in CI — is the same five-step pipeline:

```
capture ──▶ curate ──▶ evaluate ──▶ report ──▶ improve
(traces)   (dataset)   (score)     (results)   (harden / optimize)
   ▲                                                 │
   └─────────────── re-run to confirm ◀──────────────┘
```

1. **Capture** — real runs emit traces to `local.db`.
2. **Curate** — turn traces into a dataset with `curate_from_traces(...)`
   (filter by favorites, notes, guardrail hits, failures; optionally mark the
   observed output as `expected`). See [Trace Curation](curation.md).
3. **Evaluate** — `evaluate(agent_fn, dataset, scorers=[...])` runs the agent
   over each case and applies each scorer. It returns `EvalResults`.
4. **Report** — `results.summary()` gives per-scorer average and pass-rate;
   results persist to the UI (`persist=True` by default) and can publish to the
   platform or `compare()` against a prior run.
5. **Improve** — feed failures back: [harden](agent-hardening.md) proposes
   fixes, [optimize](optimization.md) searches prompts/few-shots, and
   [simulate](agent-hardening.md) generates fresh adversarial scenarios. Then
   re-run to confirm.

!!! info "Verified against a live run"
    `evaluate(agent_fn=agent.run, dataset=[...], scorers=["contains", GEval(...)])`
    ran the agent over the dataset and returned a summary with a per-scorer
    average and pass rate for both the code scorer and the live LLM judge —
    confirming the dataset → run → score → report path end to end.

The core call is deliberately small:

```python
results = evaluate(
    agent_fn=my_agent.run,          # anything callable(input) -> output
    dataset="cases.jsonl",          # Dataset | path | list[dict]
    scorers=["exact_match", geval], # strings resolve from the registry; or pass instances
    concurrency=4,                  # cases scored in parallel
    persist=True,                   # write to local.db for the UI
)
```

## Scorer families — and when to reach for each

A scorer maps `(output, expected, context)` to a number. They fall into
families by *what they judge*:

| Family | Judges | Examples | Cost |
|--------|--------|----------|------|
| **Core** | Exact/structural correctness | `exact_match`, `contains`, `json_valid`, `regex_match`, `length_between`, `latency`, `cost_under` | Free (code) |
| **Similarity** | Closeness to a reference answer | `SemanticSimilarity`, `BLEUScore`, `ROUGEScore`, `LevenshteinDistance` | Free–cheap (embeddings cost a little) |
| **LLM-as-Judge** | Open-ended quality against a rubric | `LLMJudge`, `GEval` (steps + rubric + Auto-CoT) | Paid (one LLM call/case) |
| **RAG** | Grounding in retrieved context | `Faithfulness`, `AnswerRelevancy`, `ContextPrecision`, `ContextRecall` | Paid (LLM) |
| **Safety** | Harmful/leaky output | `PIILeakage` (regex), `Toxicity`, `Bias`, `PromptInjection`, `OpenAIModeration` | Mixed (regex free, judges paid) |
| **Trajectory** | The *process* (which tools, what path) | `ToolUsageAccuracy`, `StepEfficiency`, `PathCorrectness`, `CycleEfficiency`, `ToolCallCorrectness` | Free (code over the trace) |
| **Session** | Multi-turn coherence | `ConversationCoherence`, `GoalCompletion`, `KnowledgeRetention`, `RoleAdherence`, `ConversationRelevancy` | Mixed (heuristic or LLM) |
| **Agent metrics** | Task-level judgments | `TaskCompletion`, `Hallucination`, `ReflectionQuality` | Paid (LLM) |

Choose by **what you care about**: exact answer → Core; "close enough" prose →
Similarity; open-ended quality with no single right answer → LLM-Judge/G-Eval;
did it use the right tools in the right order → Trajectory; is a multi-turn
conversation coherent → Session; is a RAG answer grounded → RAG; is the output
safe → Safety.

!!! info "Free vs paid"
    Core, trajectory, and most similarity scorers are pure code — run them
    liberally, including in CI. LLM-Judge, RAG, agent-metric, and the
    LLM-backed safety/session scorers each cost an inference call per case;
    they catch nuance code can't, but budget for them. Mix cheap scorers for
    coverage with a judge or two for the judgment calls.

## Two ways to score: dataset loop vs. direct

- **Dataset loop** — `evaluate(...)` calls `agent_fn` on each case and applies
  the scorers. This is the common path for input/output scorers.
- **Direct** — trajectory and session scorers judge a *process*, so you call
  them directly with the trajectory/turns, e.g.
  `ToolUsageAccuracy().score(actual_trajectory=..., expected_trajectory=...)`.
  See [Trajectory Scoring](trajectory-scoring.md) and [Session Scoring](session-scoring.md).

## Evaluation in your workflow

- **Dev / unit test** — assert on a few cases with the [pytest plugin](pytest.md)
  (`@case`, `pytest_dataset`).
- **Pre-release** — run a golden dataset and `compare()` to the last version.
- **CI gate** — run cheap (code) scorers on every PR; fail the build on a
  regression threshold.
- **Production** — curate from live traces and re-evaluate to catch drift.

# Replay Fidelity Guarantees

This page documents what Agent Replay captures, what it can faithfully
reproduce, and where the known fidelity gaps are. Each guarantee is
backed by a test in
[`tests/test_replay_determinism.py`](https://github.com/fastaiagent/fastaiagent-sdk/blob/main/tests/test_replay_determinism.py).

## Determinism modes

`ForkedReplay.with_determinism(mode)` controls how the LLM is invoked
during a rerun:

| Mode | LLM HTTP call | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `"live"` *(default)* | Yes — uses the captured temperature/seed. | Nondeterministic for non-zero temperature. Matches the original behavior. |
| `"recorded"` | **No** — replays the captured response. | Byte-identical to the original. Use for regression tests. |
| `"deterministic"` | Yes — but with `temperature=0` and `seed=42` forced. | Semantically stable across runs where the provider supports `seed`. |

```python
from fastaiagent.trace.replay import Replay

replay = Replay.load(trace_id)
forked = (
    replay
    .fork_at(step=0)
    .modify_prompt("Be more concise.")
    .with_determinism("recorded")  # ← skips the LLM call entirely
)
result = forked.rerun()
```

## What `"recorded"` mode captures

The recorded `LLMResponse` is reconstructed from these GenAI
semantic-convention attributes on the captured `llm.*` span:

* `gen_ai.response.content` — main text output
* `gen_ai.response.finish_reason` — `stop`, `length`, etc.
* `gen_ai.response.tool_calls` — tool invocations the original LLM
  requested (JSON-decoded into `ToolCall` instances)

If `FASTAIAGENT_TRACE_PAYLOADS=0` was set on the original run, none
of these attributes are present and `recorded` mode raises
`ReplayError`. The fix is to enable payloads on the runs you intend
to replay later.

### Multi-turn replay (v1.14.1+)

For a multi-turn tool-loop trace with N captured `llm.*` spans,
`recorded` mode installs the **full ordered sequence** of responses
(sorted by `start_time`) and pops the front entry for each
`LLMClient.acomplete` call during rerun. So:

* Turn 1 of the rerun gets the trace's first captured response.
* Turn 2 gets the second, etc.
* If the rerun makes **more** LLM calls than the original captured
  (e.g. a tool override that triggers an extra reasoning turn), the
  queue drains and subsequent calls fall through to a **live**
  provider call — the agent doesn't deadlock.

Pre-v1.14.1 the same first response was returned for every LLM call
in the rerun, which made tool-loop replays nonsensical (every turn
parroted turn 1).

## Known fidelity gaps

These are documented limitations to set expectations. Each is tracked
in the top-3-recommendation as a deferred follow-up.

### Streaming chunks aren't recorded granularly

Streaming responses (`agent.astream(...)`) yield individual
`StreamEvent` chunks, but only the **final accumulated content**
lands in `gen_ai.response.content`. `recorded` mode reconstructs the
LLMResponse from that final text — streaming cadence is lost.

For most regression-test scenarios this is fine: the final answer is
what you're testing. If you need per-chunk fidelity, file an issue —
granular streaming capture is on the deferred-follow-up list.

### Tool execution is rerun, not recorded

`recorded` mode skips the LLM call but **does not** skip tool calls.
If the LLM's recorded response includes a tool invocation, that tool
will execute live during rerun. Two ways to handle this:

* **`with_tool_override(name, stub)`** — replace a single tool with
  a deterministic stand-in. Other tools keep their reconstructed
  implementations. Multiple calls compose.
* **`with_tools([...])`** — full replacement. All tools come from
  the list you pass; nothing is reconstructed from the trace.

```python
forked.with_tool_override("search_kb", deterministic_stub)
forked.with_tool_override("create_ticket", another_stub)
```

#### Marking tools with `replay_class`

Rather than override tools by hand on every rerun, declare each tool's
replay-safety class once at definition time. The central Replay engine reads it
(off the `fastaiagent.tool.replay_class` span attribute) to decide, per call,
whether to re-execute or inject the recorded output:

| `replay_class` | Replay behavior |
|----------------|-----------------|
| `"read_only"` | May be **re-executed** (no side effects — a GET, a pure lookup). |
| `"idempotent"` | Recorded output is **injected** (re-running is safe but unnecessary). |
| `"side_effecting"` | Recorded output is **injected**; never re-executed. |

```python
from fastaiagent.tool import tool

@tool(name="search_kb", replay_class="read_only")
def search_kb(query: str) -> str:
    ...

@tool(name="create_ticket")           # unmarked → "side_effecting" (safe default)
def create_ticket(summary: str) -> str:
    ...
```

The default is `"side_effecting"`, and a value is **never auto-inferred** — a
`GET` `RESTTool` is not automatically `read_only`. See
[Tools → Replay safety](../tools/index.md#replay-safety-replay_class).

### Provider-specific determinism support

| Provider | `temperature=0` | Seed support |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI / Azure OpenAI | ✅ | ✅ via `seed=` |
| Anthropic | ✅ | ✅ via `seed=` |
| Gemini (native wire) | ✅ | ✅ via `seed=` |
| Bedrock | ✅ | ❌ — Bedrock has no `seed` field |
| Ollama / vLLM / local | ✅ | ✅ via `seed=` |
| Provider presets (groq, openrouter, mistral, …) | ✅ | Varies — most pass through `seed=` |

`deterministic` mode degrades gracefully on Bedrock — it forces
`temperature=0` and skips the seed. Output is still much more
reproducible than `live` but not byte-identical across runs.

## Divergence detection

`forked.compare(result)` now computes the first divergence by walking
the original and rerun step lists in parallel. Span names and span
output attributes are compared step-for-step; the first mismatch wins.

This replaces the v1.13 behavior of hardcoding `diverged_at` to the
fork point — which was misleading because the actual divergence often
happens later than where the user asked to fork.

```python
comp = forked.compare(rerun_result)
assert comp.compare_status == "ok"
if comp.diverged_at is None:
    print("rerun matched the original step-for-step")
else:
    print(f"diverged at step {comp.diverged_at}: "
          f"{comp.original_steps[comp.diverged_at].span_name}")
```

When the rerun trace can't be loaded (e.g., `Agent.arun` failed),
`compare_status` is set to `"rerun_failed"` and `diverged_at` stays
`None` — so UIs can distinguish "matched everything" from "couldn't
tell".

## Saving a rerun as a regression test

`rerun.save_as_test(...)` appends a JSONL line in the format
`evaluate()` reads natively:

```python
rerun.save_as_test(
    "regression_tests.jsonl",
    input="What is our refund policy?",
    expected_output=str(rerun.new_output),
    source_trace_id=original_trace_id,
)
```
